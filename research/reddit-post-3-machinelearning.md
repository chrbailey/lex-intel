[D] China AI Weekly: ByteDance releases Doubao 2.0, Ant Group open-sources trillion-parameter hybrid reasoning model, embodied intelligence debate heats up

BODY:
I track Chinese AI news from 11 Chinese-language sources (36Kr, Huxiu, CSDN, Caixin, Leiphone, etc.) and translate the highlights weekly. Here's what stood out this week:

**ByteDance Ships Doubao Large Model 2.0 + Seedance 2.0**

ByteDance released both Doubao 2.0 (their flagship LLM) and Seedance 2.0 (video generation) simultaneously, merging the Doubao and Jimeng product lines into a single platform. Covered across 3 sources (Leiphone, 36Kr, CSDN) — this is their biggest model release since Doubao 1.5 last year. The integration signals ByteDance consolidating its AI stack rather than running parallel product experiments.

**Ant Group Open-Sources Ring-2.5-1T**

Ant Group (Alibaba's fintech arm) open-sourced Ring-2.5-1T, described as the world's first hybrid linear architecture trillion-parameter reasoning model. The "hybrid linear" architecture is notable — it's distinct from standard transformer architectures and suggests Chinese labs are exploring alternative scaling approaches, not just following the GPT scaling playbook.

**Embodied Intelligence: When Does It Hit Its "ChatGPT Moment"?**

BAAI (Beijing Academy of AI) hosted a roundtable with Tsinghua professors and startup founders asking when embodied intelligence reaches mass adoption. Meanwhile, a Tsinghua-affiliated embodied brain company raised "hundreds of millions" in just two months. ARK Invest's complexity estimate: humanoid robots are 200,000x more complex than robotaxis.

**Other signals:**
- Baidu's Wenxin Assistant claims 4x user growth, positioning for the AI search entry point
- Heilongjiang province now offers 10% subsidies for AI/digital transformation projects — policy diffusing from tier-1 cities to provinces
- MiniMax open-sourced M2.5, deployed on Huawei Ascend hardware within hours
