TITLE:
Chinese AI labs are diverging from the Western playbook — here's what I'm seeing from 11 Chinese-language sources

BODY:
I run a pipeline that scrapes 11 Chinese AI/tech news sources daily and translates them for English-speaking audiences. Some patterns I'm noticing that don't get coverage in Western AI media:

**1. Hardware-software vertical integration is accelerating**

MiniMax open-sourced their M2.5 model and within *hours* it was running on Huawei's Ascend Atlas chips. This isn't just about DeepSeek — China's AI ecosystem is building tight coupling between domestic models and domestic silicon. The speed of integration suggests this has been coordinated behind the scenes.

**2. Alternative architectures, not just scaling**

Ant Group's Ring-2.5-1T uses a "hybrid linear architecture" — not a standard transformer. Chinese labs seem more willing to explore non-transformer approaches at trillion-parameter scale. Whether this is necessity (chip constraints) or genuine innovation remains to be seen.

**3. AI policy is diffusing to provincial governments**

Heilongjiang (a northeastern agricultural province, not a tech hub) now offers 10% subsidies for AI and digital transformation. When provincial-level governments start writing AI incentives into industrial policy, it signals the transition from "tech experiment" to "national infrastructure."

**4. The embodied intelligence investment wave**

Multiple roundtables this week about when humanoid robots hit their "ChatGPT moment." A Tsinghua-affiliated robotics company raised hundreds of millions in 2 months. The funding velocity in Chinese embodied AI is intense right now.

**Sources**: 36Kr, Huxiu, Leiphone, CSDN, InfoQ China, Caixin, and others. I can share specific article links if anyone's interested in digging deeper into any of these.
